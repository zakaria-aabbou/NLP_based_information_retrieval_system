# NLP_based_information_retrieval_system

The information retrieval methods are needed to find the most relevant documents to
a given query. The words contained in the web pages can be modeled using different
approaches such as Boolean models, vector space models, and probabilistic models.
In this project, we have decided to use the vector space models and particularly the
Doc2Vec (or word2vec) technique.

This project aims at developing an information retrieval system based on the word
embedding technique “Doc2Vec (or word2vec)”. The documents and the query will be
represented by embedding vectors. The similarity between the query vector and each
document will be computed using cosine similarity measure. Furthermore, to measure
the effectiveness of this information retrieval system, you might use the TREC test collection
(dataset) available on this website: https://trec.nist.gov/data.html
